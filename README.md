# Magical Mapmaking

This is a just-for-fun repository of random templates of compasses, maps, and mapmaking ideas that folks can use for creative purposes. 

## Cartography & Old Maps

Cartography is the making of a map, that defines or represents the world around them in some shape or fashion. For a longer explanation, check out [this page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cartography). 

One of the first maps that used a "rose compass" was from 1375. [The Catalan Atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Atlas), likely produced by Cresque Abraham is a Medieval world map, meant to be displayed on a table and walked around (see orientation of drawings shift around the edges). Lots of cool things in this map, aside from the first rose compass (see below), if you look closely you can find the drawing of the **Melusine Siren/Mermaid** that was probably used as a template for the [original Starbucks (Starbucks Coffee, Tea, and Spice) (circa 1971) logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5d/Old_Mermaid.jpg/1599px-Old_Mermaid.jpg) on this map (bottom right)!

Here's a close up of one of the first documented rose compasses (cardinal directions) used on a map (in the left hand panel).

## Map Styles

Through the ages, map styles have changed immensely. But they can be beautifully artistic, and it is amazing to see some of the creative maps from centuries past. Check out this map of Netherlands/Belgium/Luxembourg in the shape of a Lion from 1609 by Claes Janz Visscher ([*Leo Belgicus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Belgicus)). The lion was commonly used in the coat of arms for that region.
